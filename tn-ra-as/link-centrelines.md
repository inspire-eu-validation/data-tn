# Link centrelines

**Version**: 1

**Purpose**: Verify that Rail links intersections are consistent with the real world.

**Prerequisites**

**Test method**

* Verify that the centrelines of Rail links fall within the extent of the physical real world object that they represent, if the RailLink feature is indicated as not being 'fictitious', i.e. check for each RailLink object with a property 'fictitious' with a value 'false' that its centerline geometry falls within the extent of the physical real world object that they represent.
